# junitparams_example
Short example on how to combine JUnitParams, CommonsCSV and Selenium to create data-driven tests.

JUnitParams is a nice library that adds a new runner to JUnit and allow us to execute parameterized tests 
in a much easier and readable way. CommonsCSV in the other hand, is a library to read and parse CSV files easily.
We can combine both libraries to read data from an external source and use it to test multiple combinations of 
inputs over the feature under test.
